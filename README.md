# Bot Battlr

## Author
<p>Felix Omondi</p>

## Introduction
<p>This project involves building out a React application that allows a user to display a list of available bots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot.</p>

## Project Setup
<ul>
<li>Create a new project folder.</li>
<li>Create a new GitHub repository.</li>
<li>In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/157IfYxr4Bp63-ByF1g1wCP1uOpQ5i2R4/view">data</a> for your server DB.</li>
<li>Run this command to get the backend started: <small>npx json-server --watch data/db.json
</small></li>
<li>Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: <small>http://localhost:3000/bots</small></li>
</ul>

## Project Guidelines
<p>Users should be able to:
<ul>
<li>See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.</li>
<li>Add an individual bot to their army by clicking on it.
<li> Release a bot from my army by clicking on it.</li>
<li> Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
"x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the frontend.</li>
<li>Choose if they want to enlist a bot into their army or just see their data.</li>
</ul>
